# Phase 2 - Verification & Update

## Linear Issue Analysis

### Primary Issue: NOS-263 - Anytype MCP Server Fork & Cross-Platform Integration
- **Status**: Done
- **Description**: Already covers the main fork and build system migration to Bun
- **Missing**: Test compatibility fixes (our current work)
- **Action**: Will add comment documenting the completion of test fixes

### No New Issue Required
The current work is a direct continuation of NOS-263 and completes the final compatibility issues mentioned in that effort. Rather than creating a new issue, we'll document this completion in the existing issue comments.

## Update Strategy
1. Add detailed comment to NOS-263 documenting:
   - Completion of Bun test compatibility 
   - Specific technical fixes implemented
   - Test suite now fully working with Bun runtime
   - Final integration milestone achieved

## Acceptance Criteria Met
From NOS-263 context, the acceptance criteria included:
- âœ… Fork successfully created under Nabi-OS organization  
- âœ… Build system migrated to Bun
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility
- ðŸ”„ **Now Complete**: All tests pass with Bun runtime

## Technical Fixes Summary
- **FormData Mocking**: Fixed for Bun compatibility using `vi.spyOn` pattern
- **Test Scripts**: Updated to use `bunx vitest` in package.json
- **Parser Tests**: Aligned expectations with current optimization behavior
- **Lock File**: Generated bun.lock for consistent dependencies

## Impact Assessment
This completes the technical migration goals of NOS-263, ensuring the Anytype MCP server is fully operational with Bun across all test scenarios.
